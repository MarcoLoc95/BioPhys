# Quantitative descriptions

Quite some years ago, on a lovely afternoon, my mom and her sister were chatting in the living room. Then, as my aunt was nostalgically reminiscing about their mother's cooking skills, a heated argument suddenly sparked. Disturbed by the sudden chaos in the house I decided to go talk to them to see what the quarrel was about. It turned out that the disagreement was about the exact quantity of flour needed to bake my grandma's world renowned apple pie. My mom claimed that any deviation from the canonical $200\,g$ of flour would completely ruin the pie, while my aunt insisted that later adjustments to the recipe optimized the quantity to $230\,g$. Unfortunately, my grandma never wrote down her recipes, maybe in a bitter attempt not to share her culinary secrects with her envious cousins. To settle the argument, I cleverly proposed a bake-off, where I would be the judge, and they both accepted the challenge. After sampling two delicious pies in a repeated blind experiment, I could not tell the difference between the two, and the family had to reach a compromise that both versions of the apple pie were acceptable and valid.

Why did the pies turned out to be undistinguishable? The main reason is because the quantity of flour was not reported scientifically. Not only because it was not properly documented, but most importantly because the acceptable values were in a certain range. Imagine if one single gram of flour would dramatically change the taste of a dessert: restaurants would look more like high precision laboratories, and cooking at home would be a nightmare. Assuming that in my family's quirrel the truth was in the middle, and both variations would still be acceptable, the amount of flour should have been reported as following:

$$
 m_{\text{flour}}=215\pm15\,g
$$

Motivation: Can we measure the true value of a quantity?

reproducibility and predictability are advantages of quantitative descriptions

### Precision vs. accuracy

One of the most fundamental concepts in physics is the difference between accuracy and precision.

### The true value (?) of a quantity
Is it precise? Is it accurate?
