# Uncertainty and errors

### How to report a measurement with its error and significant digits. Rounding rules.

+ relative error

### Types of errors


### Distribution of statistical errors
Probability to measure a certain value
Probability density $p(x)$
Mean, variance, standard deviation
Model for $p(x)$: Gaussian distribution with parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma$
Estimates for $\mu$ and $\sigma$ from discrete measurements: mean, corrected sampled standard deviation, root mean squared error
Standard deviation of the mean: Central limit theorem
Standard error of the mean$m$

### Error propagation
Recap: Taylor expansion
Taylor expansion of the velocity
General formula
Special case of power laws
