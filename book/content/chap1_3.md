>My friends studying physics keep japping about the speed of light in vacuum being equal to 1. What is this nonsense? Did they completely lose their minds?
>
>The answer is: maybe they did lose their minds (and it's not up to us to judge), but what they state is not false. The reason why they are right is a bit conceptually complicated, but the idea is that, once we establish that a physical quantity is an actual constant, completely independent from any circumstance, we can set that constant to **any** value. Think of this as choosing a conversion factor that makes the math easier. You’re not changing any physical reality, you’re just redefining how you measure things. Of course, all the derived quantities will have a different (but consistent) numerical values.

>Take as an example the speed of light in vacuum $c$. If its canonical value is $c=299792458\,m/s$ it's only because we defined what a meter and what a second are. And this, maybe to the surprise of the reader, are fundamentally arbitrary.
> Say we decide to redefine it to $c=1\,m/s$. The definition of either space or time must change to keep this choice consistent. 
>
> Say we keep the same definition of time because we are still satisfied with it. What is a meter? If we know that in one second light travels $299792458\,m$, then we can say that $1/299792458$ of the distance travelled by light in one second is exactly one meter.

>Correct? Well, let's calculate this formula explicity using $c=1$:

>$$
> 1\,m = \frac{1\cdot 1\,s}{299792458} =frac{1}{299792458}\,s

>Wait, what?!? The dimensions of length are now the same as those of time? Are time and space the same? Well, according to Einstein and every physicist working with relativity, yes. In relativity, space and time are intertwined into a single framework called spacetime, and the equations become much clearer when $c$ is set to 1. Think for example of the famous equation that relates the energy and the mass, $E=mc^2$: under this new convention, $E=m$. Indeed, mass is essentially "frozen energy" that can be released under certain conditions. In contexts like nuclear physics, this equivalence explain how stars shine and how nuclear reactors work.

>It may sound overcomplicated and unnecessary, and for biophysics it is. You may now take a breath of relief: we won't need to change the definitions of fundamental dimensions. But I think it's good, sometimes, to challenge your understanding of reality and Nature, hence this long digression.
