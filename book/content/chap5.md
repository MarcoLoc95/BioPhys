# 5 - Waves: how the Universe is interconnected


what are waves: propagation of a disturbance
        \item what do they transfer: energy, momentum, and information (no particles)
        \item 2 types
        \item Waves in biology: senses, activity in the brain, signaling waves Erk
        \item transversal vs. longitudinal
        \item velocity $v$, $x_1=x_0 + v t_1$

### Wave equation
        \item derivation of wave equation

### Harmonic waves
        \item Special solution to wave equation
        \item phase, wavelength, wave number, period, frequency, angular frequency, velocity (set by the medium)
        \item Most common way to describe a wave
        $$u(x,t) = u_0 \sin(k x -\omega t)$$
        \item Energy and intensity of a wave
        \item Sound waves and the logarithm scale
