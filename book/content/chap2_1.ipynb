    "### Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In mathematics, a function is very broadly defined as the relation between an \"input value\" and an \"output value\". Functions are often denoted by a letter such as $f$, $g$ or $h$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, one simple function $f$ can be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f: x \\rightarrow 2\\cdot x +1\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that, for every value of $x$ as an input, we assign a value $2\\cdot x+1$ as an output. For simplicity, the output is denoted as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(x)=2\\cdot x +1\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Given any value of $x$ we now know a formula to get automatically $f(x)$. we can, for example, fill in a table like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "\n",
    "|$\\quad\\,\\, x \\quad\\,\\,$    | $\\quad f(x)\\quad$ | \n",
    "| :-: | :-: |\n",
    "| -2 | -3 \n",
    "| -1 | -1 \n",
    "| 0 | 1 \n",
    "| 1 | 3 \n",
    "| 2 | 5 \n",
    "\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are very useful because we can manipulate them mathematically without writing them esplicitly. Using the same example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{3\\cdot(2\\cdot x +1)}{(2\\cdot x +1)-2} \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad \\frac{3f(x)}{f(x)-2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A function can depend on multiple inputs that are independent from each other:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(x,\\alpha,\\beta)=\\alpha\\cdot x +\\beta\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that we can choose any combination of $x$, $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ and for it calculate the output. When an input can change we call it **variable**; when it is fixed (constant), we call it **parameter**. Variables are usually denoted with letters like $x$, $y$, $z$, $t$, $w$ and so on; parameters are usually denoted with Greek letters $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, $\\gamma$ and so on. Occasionally, constants are also called with the first letters of the alphabet $a$, $b$, $c$ and so on. In the previous example $x$ is the variable and $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ the parameters. In other words, parameters represent fixed numbers that are not given explicitly.\n",

    "y=f(x)\n",
