# Motion in space and time

### Point particles
What is a point particle (ribosome vs. cell)
Introduction of space and time: distance vs. direction

### Velocity
measuring velocities: path-length velocity vs. instantaneous velocity
velocity as the derivative
speed
velocity from discrete data

### Acceleration
acceleration as the rate of change of the velocity
2D velocity and ND velocities
