# Equation of motion: an inverse problem
How to get $x(t)$ from $v(t)$ or $a(t)$.
Equation of motion
Working-definition of Newton's law
with $F=F(x,v,t)$, cons, oscillations, friction
Solving ODEs and checking a given 'Ansatz'
integrate $a(t)=const.$ to obtain $x(t)$,
initial conditions for a unique solution
