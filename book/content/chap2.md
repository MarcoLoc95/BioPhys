# 2 - Kinematics: life in motion

important concepts to understand different intracellular dynamics. Is something floating randomly, or actively propelling?

### Point particles in space and time
What is a point particle (ribosome vs. cell)
Introduction of space and time: distance vs. direction

### Velocity
measuring velocities: path-length velocity vs. instantaneous velocity
velocity as the derivative
speed
velocity from discrete data

### Acceleration
acceleration as the rate of change of the velocity
2D velocity and ND velocities

### Equation of motion: an inverse problem
How to get $x(t)$ from $v(t)$ or $a(t)$.
Equation of motion
Working-definition of Newton's law
with $F=F(x,v,t)$, cons, oscillations, friction
Solving ODEs and checking a given 'Ansatz'
integrate $a(t)=const.$ to obtain $x(t)$,
initial conditions for a unique solution
