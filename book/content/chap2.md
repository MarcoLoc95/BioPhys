# 2 - Kinematics: life in motion

What distinguishes animals and plants from inorganic matter is the capacity for growth, reproduction, functional activity and continual change. All these would not be possible without *motion* at some biological level.

Measuring biological motion is actually at the base of many scientific discoveries: from decoding how molecular motors drive cellular processes to modeling how coordinated tissue movements sculpt developing organisms, the principles of motion underpin everything from muscle contraction to whole-organism locomotion.

Through analysis of motion we can infer important biological insights. Consider for instance sexual reproduction: mammalian sperm cells propel themselves using flagella, while flowering plants diffuse sperm through pollen. Do these processes require energy? Are they random? Today we know that the obvious answer is that mammalian sperm cells require energy to move, while pollen can simply diffuse in the air. But, back in 1827, Scottish botanist Robert Brown was convinced of the opposite while looking through a microscope at the motion of pollen in water. How can something moving so fast be pushed only by random forces? Later in the book we will discuss again Brownian motion, so no need to spoil the answer just yet. For now, it should suffice to know that by **tracking** the position of a particle in time we can tell quite accurately if a process is random or not.

Watch the following recording of eukaryotic cells under a microscope while you ask yourself: is cell motion random or does it need energy?

Aside from our biophysical motivation, kinematics is typically the first topic touched by introductory physics books. That is because it can be treated quantitatively from intuitive concepts that are explained with relatively easy calculus. It is therefore a great sandbox to first get acquainted with physics and the power of its mathematical language.
