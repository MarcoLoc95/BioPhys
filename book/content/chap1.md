# 1 - The language of Nature

### Why should I study physics?
This is an incredibly common question among biology scholars, and one that few even asked me personally. I find it extremely relevant, and I thought this could be the perfect incipit of this book.

Instead of giving you an answer, I suggest you to watch the following video while you ask yourself: **can biology exist without physics?**

Please take this question very seriously, because in the next couple of minutes you will decide whether all the effort is worth it or not. Because if biology can indeed exist without physics, then you have absolutely no reason to continue reading further. Pursuing the study of biophysics would then be completely meaningless, so you should have stopped reading by now.

But... you are still reading, aren't you? 

Maybe because you sense a connection, somewhere, not well defined yet.

Maybe the electromagnetic radiation from the sun does influence how a plant develops and thrives.
Maybe fluid dynamics affects how fish and aquatic mammals swim, behave, survive or go extinct.
Maybe happiness, sadness, love, grief, nostalgia and sense of belonging all depend on how molecules diffuse in a fluid.
Maybe some invisible methematical constraints decide how many trees can populate a forest, and how many leaves each tree should have.
Maybe gravity shapes the anatomy, the strength of a muscle fiber, the bone structure that allow a bird to fly.
Maybe the choreography of a flock of birds is dictated by the magnetic field of the Earth.
Maybe surface tension is the reason why insects can even exist.

Maybe there are rules, woven in the fabric of the universe, engraved in the four fundamental forces, that inevitably predict the emergence of life on our planet.

Whenever you might feel discouraged, come back to this simple question and hold on to that intuition.
Yes, the language of Nature can be challenging sometimes, and you'll find that very few people are fluent in it, and no one really a native speaker. But, once you start practicing it, it can also be extremely rewarding.
