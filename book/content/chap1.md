### Why should I study physics?
This is an incredibly common question among biology scholars, and one that few even asked me personally. I find it extremely relevant, and I thought this could be the perfect incipit of this book.

Instead of giving you an answer, I suggest you to watch the following video while you ask yourself: **can biology exist without physics?**

Please take this question very seriously, because in a couple of minutes you will decide whether all the effort is worth it or not. 

If biology can indeed exist without physics, then you have no reason to continue reading further. Your intuition initially told you that this course would be useless, and surprisingly you found yourself confirmed in this conviction. 

Pursuing the study of biophysics would then be completely meaningless.

But... you are still reading, aren't you?
