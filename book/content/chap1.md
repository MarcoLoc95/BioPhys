# 1 - The language of Nature

### Why should I study physics?
This is an incredibly common question among biology scholars, and one that few even asked me personally. I find it extremely relevant, and I thought this could be the perfect incipit of this book.

Instead of giving you an answer, I suggest you to watch the following video while you ask yourself: **can biology exist without physics?**

```


Please take this question very seriously, because in the next couple of minutes you will decide whether all the effort is worth it or not. Because if biology can indeed exist without physics, then you have absolutely no reason to continue reading further. Pursuing the study of biophysics would then be completely meaningless, so you should have stopped reading by now.

But... you are still reading, aren't you? 

Maybe because you sense a connection, somewhere, not well defined yet.

Maybe the electromagnetic radiation from the sun does influence how a plant develops and thrives.
Maybe fluid dynamics affects how fish and aquatic mammals swim, behave, survive or go extinct.
Maybe happiness, sadness, love, grief, nostalgia and sense of belonging all depend on how molecules diffuse in a fluid.
Maybe some invisible methematical constraints decide how many trees can populate a forest, and how many leaves each tree should have.
Maybe gravity shapes the anatomy, the strength of a muscle fiber, the bone structure that allow a bird to fly.
Maybe the choreography of a flock of birds is dictated by the magnetic field of the Earth.
Maybe surface tension is the reason why insects can even exist.

Maybe there are rules, woven in the fabric of the universe, engraved in the four fundamental forces, that inevitably predict the emergence of life on our planet.

Whenever you might feel discouraged, come back to this simple question and hold on to that intuition.
Yes, the language of Nature can be challenging sometimes, and you'll find that very few people are fluent in it, and no one really a native speaker. But, once you start practicing it, it can also be extremely rewarding.

### Predicting the future
As humans, we do not deal well with uncertainty. Actually, most of our lives is spent in the restless effort of reducing uncertainty: when we feel sleepy we resort to caffeine because we know it will help us be more alert in the following hours; when we sign a rental agreement we don't have to worry where we will sleep the next day; when we get into an affective relationship we don't have to question if we will be alone when in need.

One hypothesis is that this has to do with our innate survival instinct, because if we can predict the future, then we can also avoid all the causes of our potential demise. While countless philosophers, psychologists and even theologists could debate forever about this aspect of the human nature, the pragmatic reader might want to know *if* and *how* we can actually predict the future.

The good news is that we can. The bad news is that we can, but only to a certain extent. In fact, we constantly make predictions about what is to come and adjust our behaviour to such predictions. Look for instance at the following video:

How can the person on the skateboard not fall? Is it sheer luck, or are they skilled in estimating how much force they need to apply on the board, how the friction of the road affects the rotation of the wheels, how they need to counterbalance gravity, the tilt of the road and inertia? At the same time, we can safely assume that in an afternoon of training this person would have fallen at a certain point. That is because the predictions can never be perfect: the friction could slightly change due to extra sand under the wheels or the tilt could change at the road goes on.

Predicting the future is possible thanks to the fact that in physics we can establish what is called **causality**. Causality is the relation between a cause and an effect. If you kick a ball at rest it will start to move, depending on how heavy it is. The force of the kick $F$ is the cause, and the acceleration $a$ is the effect. When we write:

$$
F = m \cdot a
$$

it means that we know there is a causal relation between the kick and the motion of the ball, and that we know exactly how much the ball will be accelerated if we know exactly the applied force. The primary goal of physics is to decode the *language of Nature* into simpler equations that we can use to make quantitative statements, whether it's about electromagnetic interactions, thermodynamical processes or the constituents that make up everything in the Universe.

But how is causality established? To be able to write an exact equation we must have first conducted some experiments. Say we observed many balls of different weights being kicked at different strenghts, and measured the motion of the balls to extract the accelerations.

### Correlation does not imply causation

correlation, sequence in time (that is, causes must occur before their proposed effect), a plausible physical or information-theoretical mechanism for an observed effect to follow from a possible cause, and eliminating the possibility of common and alternative ("special") causes.
