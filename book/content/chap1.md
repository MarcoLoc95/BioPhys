# 1 - The language of Nature

### Why should I study physics?
This is an incredibly common question among biology scholars, and one that few even asked me personally. I find it extremely relevant, and I thought this could be the perfect incipit of this book.

Instead of giving you an answer, I suggest you to watch the following video while you ask yourself: **can biology exist without physics?**


```{video} https://player.vimeo.com/video/1065802669?h=a3ea51e85c&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479
```


Please take this question very seriously, because in the next couple of minutes you will decide whether all the effort is worth it or not. Because if biology can indeed exist without physics, then you have absolutely no reason to continue reading further. Pursuing the study of biophysics would then be completely meaningless, so you should have stopped reading by now.

But... you are still reading, aren't you? 

Maybe because you sense a connection, somewhere, not well defined yet.

Maybe the electromagnetic radiation from the sun does influence how a plant develops and thrives.
Maybe fluid dynamics affects how fish and aquatic mammals swim, behave, survive or go extinct.
Maybe happiness, sadness, love, grief, nostalgia and sense of belonging all depend on how molecules diffuse in a fluid.
Maybe some invisible methematical constraints decide how many trees can populate a forest, and how many leaves each tree should have.
Maybe gravity shapes the anatomy, the strength of a muscle fiber, the bone structure that allow a bird to fly.
Maybe the choreography of a flock of birds is dictated by the magnetic field of the Earth.
Maybe surface tension is the reason why insects can even exist.

Maybe there are rules, woven in the fabric of the universe, engraved in the four fundamental forces, that inevitably predict the emergence of life on our planet.

Whenever you might feel discouraged, come back to this simple question and hold on to that intuition.
Yes, the language of Nature can be challenging sometimes, and you'll find that very few people are fluent in it, and no one really a native speaker. But, once you start practicing it, it can also be extremely rewarding.

### Predicting the future
As humans, we do not deal well with uncertainty. Actually, most of our lives is spent in the restless effort of reducing uncertainty: when we feel sleepy we resort to caffeine because we know it will help us be more alert in the following hours; when we sign a rental agreement we don't have to worry where we will sleep the next day; when we get into an affective relationship we don't have to question if we will be alone when in need.

One hypothesis is that this has to do with our innate survival instinct, because if we can predict the future, then we can also avoid all the causes of our potential demise. While countless philosophers, psychologists and even theologists could debate forever about this aspect of the human nature, the pragmatic reader might want to know *if* and *how* we can actually predict the future.

The good news is that we can. The bad news is that we can, but only to a certain extent. In fact, we constantly make predictions about what is to come and adjust our behaviour to such predictions. Look for instance at the following video:

```{video} https://player.vimeo.com/video/762047045?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479
```

How can the person on the skateboard not fall? Is it sheer luck, or are they skilled in estimating how much force they need to apply on the board, how the friction of the road affects the rotation of the wheels, how they need to counterbalance gravity, the tilt of the road and inertia? At the same time, we can safely assume that in an afternoon of training this person would have fallen at a certain point. That is because the predictions can never be perfect: the friction could slightly change due to extra sand under the wheels or the tilt could change at the road goes on.

Predicting the future is possible thanks to the fact that in physics we can establish what is called **causality**. Causality is the relation between a cause and an effect. The primary goal of physics is to find all the existing causalities and decode the *language of Nature* into simpler equations that we can use to make quantitative statements, whether about electromagnetic interactions, thermodynamical processes or the constituents that make up everything in the Universe.

For instance, if you kick a ball at rest it will start to move, depending on how heavy it is. The force of the kick $F$ is the cause, and the acceleration $a$ is the effect. But how is this causality established? To be able to write an exact equation we must have first conducted some experiments. Say we observed many balls of different weights being kicked at different strenghts, and measured the motion of the balls to extract the accelerations:

```{figure} ../figures/chap1_dots.png
---
width: 80%
name: 1_dots
align: center
---
```

We definitely see a pattern there! Intuition tells us that if we take a force intermediate between two data points, the accelation will also be between those two points.

```{figure} ../figures/chap1_fits.png
---
width: 80%
name: 1_fits
align: center
---
```

In this case, the relation appears to be linear: if we halve the force, the acceleration halves accordingly. If we double the force, similarly the acceleration doubles. On the contrary, for the mass there is an inverse relation: when the mass doubles, the acceleration halves. When the mass halves, the acceleration doubles.

So, we establish that:

$$
a = \frac{F}{m}
$$

In other words, when we write:

$$
F = m \cdot a
$$

it means that we know there is a causal relation between the kick and the motion of the ball, and that we know exactly how much the ball will be accelerated if we know exactly the applied force. Now if we see a soccer player kicking a ball of known mass with a known force, we can predict the trajectory of the ball with extreme precision.

### Correlation does not imply causation

Say you observe an interesting trend that everyone else have overlooked: in the past years the fossil fuel use in Burundi has boomed, and every year more you hear parents named their child "Theodore". You decide to do a proper data collection and access the biggest library with this sort of useless information, internet.

You plot the data and calculate the correlation coefficient:

```{figure} ../figures/chap1_spuriouscorr.svg
---
width: 80%
name: 1_spurious
align: center
---
```

The correlation is insanely high! You hear that, thanks to heavy subsidies to the renewable sector, fossil fuel use in Burundi will drop 50% next year. Do you think the popularity of the name "Theodore" will also drop 50%? How come this is not a law of Nature?

Maybe you start to understand why the saying "correlation does not imply causation" is so popular among scientists. To establish causality, correlation is only one of the ingredients. What is also necessary is a sequence in time (effects must follow the cause and not the other way around), a plausible physical mechanism and the exclusion of possibile common causes. In this case, what is missing is the plausible physical mechanism behind this correlation: no physical theory could reliably predict the relation

$$
\text{Babies named "Theodore"} = k \cdot \text{Fossil fuel use in Burundi}, \qquad \text{where } k \text{ is a constant}
$$

Not only, but if we were to forbid by law naming children "Theodore", we would see the correlation deteriorate immediately. This is the main reason theoretical (bio)physics is just as important as experimental (bio)physics. Without a solid, sound, predictive model, experiments are only collections of data points. This came to be a recipe of success for physics: experimentalists try to find loopholes and counterexemples to break the models theoreticians make, and theoreticians try to extend the models to explain and predict the experimental outcomes. This apparent "fight" is only beneficial to scientific progress and has resulted in very solid theories and very advanced experimental setups. 

### A philosophical note and a suggestion for the future biophysicist
The approach to physics described above is called **determinism**. Thanks to determinism and its accurate predictions, we could develop technology and control Nature to a level that was unthinkable to the early hominids on Earth. But one problem arises with it. In a utopic, deterministic world where we know everything about the state of the Universe at a certain time, every position and velocity of every particle, every charge, every force acting between every particle, then we can predict how the Universe will be in a minute, a year, a million years from now. Everything, including me writing this digital book and you reading it.

Some philosophers got scared about this idea, and rightly so, because it would imply that free will does not exist. If in this very moment you decide to get up and get a glass of water, is it because you decided, or because a chain reaction of neurotransmitters triggered by a mix of internal and external stimuli made you get up? In the attempted rejection of pure determinism, some argued that laws of Nature were indeed true and fixed, but the *absolute knowledge* of a system with infinite accuracy and precision will always be impossible to achieve. Variations and unpredictability are possible because we lack absolute knowledge, and we can keep a sense of free will (even if it's not really there).

That was the debate until the advent of quantum mechanics. There, experiments conducted under the most controlled conditions appeared to give random results. Or, better said, the best achiavable prediction was a probability distribution. Scientists developed the theory behind quantum mechanics with precise equations and models, that would predict not the outcomes, but the probability distributions of the outcomes. Quantum mechanics gave more space to **probabilistic determinism**, allowing fundamental unpredictability and saving the concept of free will. Even with absolute knowledge about the Universe at a certain time, the future can diverge in infinite ways the further we progress in time. How do we explain this fundamental unpredictability, if the macroscopic world is still fairly predictable? Scientists do not agree about the correct interpretation of quantum mechanics and keep coming up with more or less convincing explanations.

At this point, I hope you did not get a headache from this philosophical diversion. You can of course build your own beliefs about the nature of science, you can change your mind multiple times throughout your career and even allow yourself not to worry about it. But if you feel lost and seek my personal advice, let me reassure you that as a biologist or biophysicist you will encounter little to no quantum effects. What we know about biological systems so far is that they largely obey deterministic laws. Unpredictability arises from the **complexity** of the systems considered, were is absolute knowledge is unattainable. This complexity can explain both reproducible trends in biolog and variability in the outcomes. Your task as a biophysicist would probably involve modeling this complexity into simpler concepts, or explore it via experimental means.
