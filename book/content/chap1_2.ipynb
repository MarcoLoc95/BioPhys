    "# Uncertainty and errors\n",
    "If there needs to be one thing you must remember from this lesson, let it be this: every measurement or prediction in physics comes with an associated uncertainty. Always, no exception. That is because measurements provide an *estimate* of the true value, not the true value itself. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of quantitative measurements, the words **uncertainty** and **error** are sometimes used interchangeably. To be precise, error generally refers to the difference between a measured value and the true or accepted value, while uncertainty is an estimate of the range within which the true value is likely to lie, considering all known errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "We cannot stress it enough: uncertainty is always present, whether we are reporting a measurement or making a prediction from the theory. Therefore it is important to know how to handle it quantitatively, regardless of where your interest in biophysics will take you.\n",
    "\n",
    "The usual way to report a physical quantity $X$ with its best estimate $x$ and its error $e_x$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "X = x \\pm e_x\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Philosophical digression**\n",
    ">\n",
    ">But what about the fundamental constants on Nature, like for example the speed of light in vacuum? Do they come with an uncertainty too? In principle no, but only because they become [axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom) of the physical framework used. For this we must be certain that they are *really* constant. In other words, whenever measured properly, the obtained value must always be within the range of uncertainty. In that case and that one only, it can be considered a fixed value of Nature and reported without error. The idea that, if we use better, more sensitive measuring tools, we would still get the same value, just with a smaller uncertainty.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Not for nothing, the speed of light in vacuum is so constant it is used together with the definition of [second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second) to define indirectly what the [meter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre) is. In the next chapter we will talk about units and dimensions, and we will come back at it.\n",
    ">\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of errors\n",
    "There are countless reasons why we cannot be certain about the values we measure. Consider for instance the measuring of the length of the table: maybe the length changes slightly from side to side due to imperfect manufacturing, or the meter we use cannot reach micrometric precision, or we accidentally measure between two points that are not exactly parallel to the length, or some evil crazy scientist replaced the meter with an inaccurate one, and so on. Some of this errors can be prevented, some other cannot. This does not mean that we cannot be precise in our scientific claims, but only that we acknowledge that what we know is limited to the tools we have to explore Nature. \n",
    "\n",
    "Errors are generally classified between these categories:\n",
    "- **Random errors**: Variations that occur unpredictably from one measurement to another, mostly due to the nature of the process. They cannot be minimized at the source, but they can be reduced by averaging over a large number of observations. An example are the differences in protein concentrations expressed by the same cell line.\n",
    "- **Systematic errors**: These are consistent, repeatable errors due to flaws in measurement instruments or procedures. Most systematic errors take the form of *biases*. They can and should be minimized at the source by properly calibrating the system. Unlike random errors, systematic errors cannot be reduced by increasing the number of observations. An example is not accounting for the mass of the weighing paper when measuring the weight of a powder.\n",
    "- **Blunders**: These are careless human errors that happen randomly and result in (completely) off results. Compared to systematic errors, blunders are due to tiredness or negligence and generate biases hard to quantify. They can be minimized with good attention, careful practices and supervision of other colleagues who can point out the obvious mistakes. An example is pipetting $1\\,mL$ of trypsin instead of $1\\,\\mu L$, or recording a $9$ instead of a $6$ onto a lab report.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some textbooks do not distinguish between systematic errors and blunders; here I want to stress that, while systematic errors can in some cases be corrected in retrospective, blunders should be categorically excluded from analysis.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Instrument resolution\n",
    "Take a ruler and ask yourself: can I measure micrometers with this?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is no. That is because the spacing between ticks on the ruler is $1\\,mm$: finer ticks would be hard if not impossible to see with the naked eye, and due to [parallax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax) they would literally be useless as different observers would report different measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The instrument resolution (sometimes called *sensitivity*) represents the smallest increment an instrument can reliably measure, its \"least count\".\n",
    "\n",
    "If we are measuring the length of a table, even after removing all other sources of errors, we cannot get an estimate of the true value more precise than the resolution of the measuring tool used. The only way to reduce this uncertainty is to use more sensitive tools with better resolution."

    "Is $1\\,m$ of uncertainty a lot? If we are measuring the snout-vent length of an animal, for sure; but if we are measuring the distance a bird can migrate in one day, it's basically negligible.\n",
    "\n",

For example, if we have two measurements $x_1=2$ and $x_2=4$, their mean is $<x>=3$ and the individual distances are $x_1-<x>=-1$ and $x_3-<x>=1$; their sum would be zero and suggest that there is no spread of the data points, which is false.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the error must be homogeneous with the measurement (have the same units, as we will see later), we define the **sampled standard deviation** $s$ as the square root of the variance:\n",

However, the intrinsic statistical variability will not be automatically eliminated; in the example of the trees, we will only get a smoother histogram of the frequencies, it's not like all the trees will change their height to match the mean. But when we then conclude that the \"true value\" must be very close to $<x>$, we know that estimate very well! One or even a hundred trees with very extreme heights would still not significantly change the prediction of what the mean is.\n",

Using the standard error of the mean instead means *\"the data points can vary from each other, but the mean you expect to calculate will most probably lie between $<x>-m$ and $<x>+m$\"*.

    "Think about how many genes could affect the height of a tree. Biology tells us that height is a complex, polygenic trait: it's not controlled by a single gene, but by the cumulative effect of many genes, each contributing a small amount to the final phenotype. So, even assuming that the chance of a mutation in an individual gene is completely unpredictable and all possible mutations have the same probability (like rolling a die), we end up with a smooth, continuous, bell-shaped distribution of heights. To understand why, we need to look more quantitatively into the math starting from discrete random processes.\n",
